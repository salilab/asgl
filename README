Description:

ASGL program produces a PostScript or Encapsulated PostScript file
that can contain scatter plots, line plots, histograms, 2D density
plots, and/or bond-and-stick plots of molecules.  Input are data 
files and a TOP program guiding the creation of a plot. TOP is an
interpretor of ASGL commands similar to Fortran. ASGL is written in
Fortran 77 and is meant to run on UNIX systems. The GNU gs previewer 
under X11 and NeXT's Preview program can be used to preview the output 
before printing it. You can also include the plots in other documents 
(tex) or edit them with other programs (Draw, Adobe Illustrator).
