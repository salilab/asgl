Supported computers:

ASGL 1.3.1 runs on Silicon Graphics Iris 4D, Convex C2, Sun 4, 
IBM RS/6000, DEC Decstation, DEC Alpha station, and compiles with 
the public domain f2c fortran-to-c translator. To obtain f2c, use 
the anonymous ftp service on research.att.com. Its IP address is 
192.20.225.2; login with the username `netlib'. The f2c translator 
allows ASGL to run on virtually any UNIX computer.




Installation:


If you have the ASGL.tar.Z distribution file:
 
  1) Unpack the distribution file:

     zcat ASGL.tar.Z | tar xvf -

     The result will be a directory ./asgl


  2) If you use tcsh Ver 6 or later than HOSTTYPE environment variable 
     is defined automatically and you can skip this step. 

     Make sure the HOSTTYPE environment variable is defined by doing 
     either of:

     a) Define HOSTTYPE in your login script file:

             for sh :  HOSTTYPE=iris4d; export HOSTTYPE

             for csh:  setenv HOSTTYPE iris4d


        Source your login script:
             
             for sh :  . script_file

             for csh:  source script_file


     b) Edit the script `src/hosttype' to produce the correct result
        on your host.



  3) Set the environment variable ASGLINSTALL to the directory where you
     want to have ASGL installed. Create this directory. For example,
     for the tcsh or csh shells:

     setenv ASGLINSTALL /usr/local/bin
     mkdir $ASGLINSTALL



  4) Compile and install the program, library files, manual, and examples:

     make all

     If you are not using one of the compilers listed above
     you will probably have to modify the Makefile in the 
     src\ sub-directory. Hopefully, you won't have to modify 
     the fortran code.

     You will also have to compile manually the program collect.f in
     the doc\ directory before you try to create the document by
     `make all'. Usually, `f77 collect.f -o collect' will do.


  5) Change your login script to include the following (for csh or tcsh):

     # Root directory for installed ASGL:
     setenv ASGLINSTALL /usr/local/bin/asgl

     # Set ASGL environment variables and update the command path:
     if (-e $ASGLINSTALL/setasgl) source $ASGLINSTALL/setasgl


   6) Source your login script. You can now start using ASGL. See
      the examples in the tests\ directory. You may (but do not have
      to) delete the ASGL distribution directory. 


   7) The `hosttype mechanism' allows transparent ASGL installation 
      and use of the same installation directory on some networks of 
      different host types. For example, at Harvard we have an NFS 
      and Yellow Pages network with only one home directory per user
      for almost all the machine types listed above. In such a case, 
      to install ASGL on another host type in the same directory, 
      you only have to login to that host, clean the distribution 
      directory by `make distclean' and do `make all' again. Exactly 
      the same commands (scripts) are used on all hosts to run the 
      ASGL programs.
