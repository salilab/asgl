Supported computers:

ASGL 1.3.1 runs on Silicon Graphics Iris 4D, Convex C2, Sun 4, 
IBM RS/6000, DEC Decstation, DEC Alpha station, and compiles with 
the public domain f2c fortran-to-c translator. To obtain f2c, use 
the anonymous ftp service on research.att.com. Its IP address is 
192.20.225.2; login with the username `netlib'. The f2c translator 
allows ASGL to run on virtually any UNIX computer.




Installation:


If you have the asgl-1.3.1.tar.gz distribution file:
 
  1) Unpack the distribution file:

     zcat asgl-1.3.1.tar.gz | tar xvf -

     The result will be a directory ./asgl-1.3.1


  2) Make sure the ASGL_EXECUTABLE_TYPE environment variable is defined
     for your architecture (see scripts/Makefile.include1 for a list):

             for sh :  ASGL_EXECUTABLE_TYPE=g77; export ASGL_EXECUTABLE_TYPE

             for csh:  setenv ASGL_EXECUTABLE_TYPE g77


        (These commands could also be put in your login script.)


  3) Set the environment variable ASGLINSTALL to the directory where you
     want to have ASGL installed. Create this directory. For example,
     for the tcsh or csh shells:

     setenv ASGLINSTALL /usr/local/bin
     mkdir $ASGLINSTALL


  4) Compile and install the program:

     make all; make install

     If you are not using one of the compilers listed above
     you will probably have to modify the Makefile in the 
     src/ sub-directory. Hopefully, you won't have to modify 
     the fortran code.


  5) Change your login script to include the following (for csh or tcsh):

     # Root directory for installed ASGL:
     setenv ASGLINSTALL /usr/local/bin/asgl

     # ASGL executable type
     setenv ASGL_EXECUTABLE_TYPE g77

     # Set ASGL environment variables and update the command path:
     if (-e $ASGLINSTALL/setasgl) source $ASGLINSTALL/setasgl


  6) Source your login script. You can now start using ASGL. See
     the examples in the examples/ directory. You may (but do not
     have to) delete the ASGL distribution directory. 


  7) To make and install the documentation, once ASGL is installed,
     run the following in the ASGL distribution directory:
      
     make man; make installman

     In order to create the document, 'collect' must be built from
     'collect.f' in the doc/ directory. You may have to do this
     manually if the Makefile is unable to do it automatically
     (it uses 'f77 collect.f -o collect').


  8) The `hosttype mechanism' allows transparent ASGL installation 
     and use of the same installation directory on some networks of 
     different host types. For example, at Harvard we have an NFS 
     and Yellow Pages network with only one home directory per user
     for almost all the machine types listed above. In such a case, 
     to install ASGL on another host type in the same directory, 
     you only have to login to that host, clean the distribution 
     directory by `make distclean' and do `make all' again. Exactly 
     the same commands (scripts) are used on all hosts to run the 
     ASGL programs.
