Hi,

This notice is sent to everybody who at some time expressed interest in ASGL.
If you are not interested anymore, please say so, so that I can remove
you from the Email-list. I will use this list to inform the interested
people about the ASGL changes in the future.

Since many people wanted to use ASGL on tammy, I have reorganized the
ASGL installation. There is only one small consequence for the users.
Please, replace the current reference to ASGL in your .cshrc, .private, or 
.aliases with a new command:

set path=($path /data/sali/bin/scripts)

For running ASGL on diamond.harvard.edu, the path is slightly different:

set path=($path /Net/tammy/data/sali/bin/scripts)

The text to be replaced looks like this:

setenv OFFICE /office/sali
if(-e /data/sali/asgl/append2cshrc) source /data/sali/asgl/append2cshrc

You can look into my tammy:/home/sali/private file for an example.

The specified directory contains the script `asgl' that selects the
proper binary executable for convex, sun, iris, ibm, or next.
The net result is that you do not have to think on which machine
you are, just run ASGL by `asgl file'.

In order to prevent clashes with the older ASGL version I will
rename it. If you still want to use it, please ask me explicitly.

****** IMPORTANT: 
The subdirectory `libasgl' contains example *.top files and the manual
manuali.ps which you can print on the 300dpi PostScript printer.
